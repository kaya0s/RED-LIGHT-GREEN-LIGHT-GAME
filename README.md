Squidgame: Redlight Greenlight is an inspired project based on a famous Korean 
show, where the gameplay simulates the iconic “Red Light, Green Light” challenge. 
However, there will be new mechanics in this version of the game. Players aim to reach 
the finish line without getting eliminated in the Red Light phase, they must stop whenever 
the light turns red and wait till the Green Light phase to continue reaching the finish line. 
The game includes several gameplay mechanics such as controlling the movement of the 
characters and its timing with other obstacles that increase the difficulty to give more 
challenges.


Gameplay Mechanics:
● Objective: The main goal for players is to reach the finish line while avoiding being 
caught during the Red Light phase. Any movement during the Red Light phase 
results in immediate elimination.
● Phases:
Green Light: Players can move toward the finish line.
Red Light: Players must stop completely, and any detected movement 
will lead to elimination.
